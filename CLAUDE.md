## What This Repo Is

Master monorepo combining SRM Concrete's dispatch routing engine, management dashboard, SOPs, and scheduling tools into a single deployable system. Replaces scattered repos (`srm-dispatch`, `SB-Management-OS`) with one source of truth.

**Primary goal:** Maximize aggregate loads delivered to plants by SRM fleet trucks, accounting for which plants receive outside hauler help and which (block plants) must be supplied exclusively by SRM drivers.

---

## Operator Context

- **Dispatcher:** Shane — sole dispatcher, sole provider, ADHD brain, Hazel Green AL
- **Dispatch Manager:** Curtis (promoted from driver — NOT in active route pool, occasionally drives 525 coverage)
- **Fleet:** 16 active drivers + Curtis backup = 17 total
- **Order System:** AUJS Classic (scale sync issues with new AU system — Classic stays)
- **Comms:** Text message dispatch to drivers
- **Hardware:** Pi 5 (16GB) local + Pulsar0100 dev workstation + future SAMSARA integration

---

## The Strategy — Load Maximization

### Outside Help Matrix

Plants that receive aggregate deliveries from **outside haulers** (not SRM fleet):

| Plant | Outside Material | What SRM Still Supplies |
|-------|-----------------|------------------------|
| 507 Stringfield | Sand | Rock (67s, 78s) |
| 508 Nick Fitcheard | Sand | Rock |
| 518 Scottsboro | Sand | Rock (MM 78s), 1/4 downs from BP |
| 525 Cullman | Sand | Rock |
| 516 Lacey Spring | Rock | Sand (POD), scrap backhaul rock |

### Block Plants — NO Outside Help (SRM Must Supply 100%)

| Plant | Materials Needed | Supply Chain |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| 907 Palmer Block | 1/4 downs, blocks, sand, specific aggregates | BP runs, CHRIS P route (APAC Tremont sand) |
| 908 Block Plant | Same as 907 | Must be covered by SRM fleet |

### Routing Priority Order
1. Block plants (907, 908) — zero outside help, SRM fleet is their only source
2. Plants with partial outside help — fill gaps outside haulers miss
3. Full-service plants (506, 511, 513, 514, 519) — SRM supplies everything
4. Scrap runs every morning — generates backhaul rock, cleans yards
5. No empty trucks — every leg carries material

```

## Route Logic Engine

### Key Files
- `src/utils/shorthand.js` — route generation (`buildShorthand`, `p`, `after514`, `endOfShift519`, `bpFirstRock`, `check518`)
- `src/utils/rotation.js` — BP cycling, calendar, cycle day
- `src/utils/loadCounter.js` — plant load counting, priority scoring (RED/YELLOW/GREEN), outside help awareness
- `src/config/crew.js` — 16 drivers, BP groups A/B/C, rotations, tabs
- `src/config/plants.js` — 19 locations, OUTSIDE_SAND/ROCK sets, SUBS map
- `src/config/distances.js` — drive time matrix, quarry close logic (960 min = 4PM)
- `src/components/PlantDashboard.jsx` — per-plant priority grid with load counts, block plant alerts

### Key Config Sets
- `OUTSIDE_SAND`: ["507","508","525","518"]
- `OUTSIDE_ROCK`: ["516"]
- `SAND_TARGETS`: ["519","506","511","513","514","516"]
- `BLOCK_PLANTS`: ["907","908"] — zero outside help, RED priority if 0 loads
- `SUBS`: fallback map when plant DOWN (907/908 have NO subs — alert Shane)

### Rotation System (`src/config/crew.js`)
- **BP Groups A/B/C** rotate on `cycleDay % 3`
- **507 Rota:** `["506","511","513","507","514"]`
- **506 Rota:** `["511","513","514","506"]`
- **Tuesday/Friday overrides:** Special BP + block plant supply runs

### Plant Substitution (`src/config/plants.js`)
When a plant is DOWN, `SUBS` map provides fallback:
```
506→[511,513,508]  507→[508,511,513]  511→[513,506,507]
513→[511,506,507]  514→[516,519,513]  516→[514,519,513]
519→[514,516,511]  525→[514,516,519]  591→[594]  594→[591]
```

## Business Rules — Do Not Break

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Block plants (907, 908) get supplied FIRST | Zero outside help — they starve without SRM fleet |
| No empty trucks | Every leg carries material — scrap out, rock back |
| CHRIS P route is FIXED | Never touch: CHER→MSAND→Tupelo→APAC→511→POD→519→PRELOAD |
| Dump trailer drivers (Chris P, Tim) NEVER do scrap runs | Equipment incompatibility |
| Bridgeport rotation is FAIR | Max 1x/week per driver, groups A/B/C rotate, Stacey+Alexis fixed |
| 514 chain rule | Delivering to 514 triggers scrap→LQ→RG rock→home chain |
| Tuesday/Friday overrides | Special BP+block supply runs for 507 and 519 crews |
| Check 518 before sending material | Call Shane (256-402-5176) or Anthony (256-924-4328) |
| Quarry close time enforced | End-of-shift routes shorten when time is tight |
| Zone rotation — no same zone >2 days | Prevents driver burnout |

---

## Design Constraints

- **ADHD-aware:** One screen, next action always obvious
- **Mobile-first:** Shane uses phone in the yard
- **Offline-capable:** Must work on Pi LAN with no internet
- **Print-friendly:** Drivers need physical route sheets
- **Copy-to-clipboard:** Tap route card → copies text for SMS dispatch

3. Weekly load report — aggregate loads per plant Mon-Fri
4. Print-friendly route sheet — one page per driver, clean layout

### Session 4 (FUTURE)

## Constitutional Alignment

Governed by [ShaneTheBrain Constitution](https://github.com/thebardchat/constitution/blob/main/CONSTITUTION.md).

Ship checklist:
- [x] Works offline on Pi
- [x] One-action UX (no multi-step friction)
- [ ] Printable output option (Session 3)
- [x] Fairness logic intact
- [x] Block plants never starved — PlantDashboard shows RED alert when 0 loads
