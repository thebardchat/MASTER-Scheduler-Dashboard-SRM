## What This Repo Is

Master monorepo combining SRM Concrete's dispatch routing engine, management dashboard, SOPs, and scheduling tools into a single deployable system. Replaces scattered repos (`srm-dispatch`, `srm-management-os`) with one source of truth.

**Primary goal:** Maximize aggregate loads delivered to plants by SRM fleet trucks, accounting for which plants receive outside hauler help and which (block plants) must be supplied exclusively by SRM drivers.

---

## Operator Context

- **Dispatcher:** Shane — sole dispatcher, sole provider, ADHD brain, Hazel Green AL
- **Dispatch Manager:** Curtis (promoted from driver — NOT in active route pool, occasionally drives 525 coverage)
- **Fleet:** 16 active drivers + Curtis backup = 17 total
- **Order System:** AUJS Classic (scale sync issues with new AU system — Classic stays)
- **Comms:** Text message dispatch to drivers
- **Hardware:** Pi 5 (16GB) local + Pulsar0100 dev workstation + future SAMSARA integration

---

## The Strategy — Load Maximization

### Outside Help Matrix

Plants that receive aggregate deliveries from **outside haulers** (not SRM fleet):

| Plant | Outside Material | What SRM Still Supplies |
|-------|-----------------|------------------------|
| 507 Stringfield | Sand | Rock (67s, 78s) |
| 508 Nick Fitcheard | Sand | Rock |
| 518 Scottsboro | Sand | Rock (MM 78s), 1/4 downs from BP |
| 525 Cullman | Sand | Rock |
| 516 Lacey Spring | Rock | Sand (POD), scrap backhaul rock |

### Block Plants — NO Outside Help (SRM Must Supply 100%)

| Plant | Materials Needed | Supply Chain |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| 907 Palmer Block | 1/4 downs, blocks, sand, specific aggregates | BP runs, CHRIS P route (APAC Tremont sand) |
| 908 Block Plant | Same as 907 | Must be covered by SRM fleet |

### Routing Priority Order
1. Block plants (907, 908) — zero outside help, SRM fleet is their only source
2. Plants with partial outside help — fill gaps outside haulers miss (rock to sand-covered plants, sand to rock-covered plants)
3. Full-service plants (506, 511, 513, 514, 519) — SRM supplies everything
4. Scrap runs every morning — generates backhaul rock, cleans yards
5. No empty trucks — every leg carries material

```
MH→506: 30    MH→511: 40    MH→513: 35    MH→507: 70    MH→519: 20

BP→518: 25    BP→907: 200   BP→511: 200
516→RG: 1     507→MM: 1     514→RG: 20    RG→507: 25
```

## Route Logic Engine

### Shorthand System (`src/utils/shorthand.js`)
Generates text-based route cards per driver. Core functions:
- `buildShorthand(name, options)` — master route builder
- `p(code, down, subMap)` — plant substitution when a plant is down
- `after514(homePlant, down, subMap)` — 514 chain rule (sand→514→scrap→LQ→RG rock→home)
- `endOfShift519()` — time-aware route shortening near quarry close
- `bpFirstRock()` — rotating BP first-rock delivery plant
- `check518()` — call Shane/Anthony before sending to 518

### Rotation System (`src/config/crew.js`)
- **BP Groups A/B/C** rotate on `cycleDay % 3`
- **507 Rota:** `["506","511","513","507","514"]`
- **506 Rota:** `["511","513","514","506"]`
- **Tuesday/Friday overrides:** Special BP + block plant supply runs

### Plant Substitution (`src/config/plants.js`)
When a plant is DOWN, `SUBS` map provides fallback:
```
506→[511,513,508]  507→[508,511,513]  511→[513,506,507]
513→[511,506,507]  514→[516,519,513]  516→[514,519,513]
519→[514,516,511]  525→[514,516,519]  591→[594]  594→[591]
```

## Business Rules — Do Not Break

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Block plants (907, 908) get supplied FIRST | Zero outside help — they starve without SRM fleet |
| No empty trucks | Every leg carries material — scrap out, rock back |
| CHRIS P route is FIXED | Never touch: CHER→MSAND→Tupelo→APAC→511→POD→519→PRELOAD |
| Dump trailer drivers (Chris P, Tim) NEVER do scrap runs | Equipment incompatibility |
| Bridgeport rotation is FAIR | Max 1x/week per driver, groups A/B/C rotate, Stacey+Alexis fixed |
| 514 chain rule | Delivering to 514 triggers scrap→LQ→RG rock→home chain |
| Tuesday/Friday overrides | Special BP+block supply runs for 507 and 519 crews |
| Check 518 before sending material | Call Shane (256-402-5176) or Anthony (256-924-4328) |
| Quarry close time enforced | End-of-shift routes shorten when time is tight |
| Zone rotation — no same zone >2 days | Prevents driver burnout |

---

## Design Constraints

- **ADHD-aware:** One screen, next action always obvious
- **Mobile-first:** Shane uses phone in the yard
- **Offline-capable:** Must work on Pi LAN with no internet
- **Print-friendly:** Drivers need physical route sheets
- **Copy-to-clipboard:** Tap route card → copies text for SMS dispatch

## Session Log — Update This Every Session

### 2026-03-14 — Session 1: Repo Bootstrap
- [x] Created CLAUDE.md and README.md
- [x] Defined load maximization strategy
- [x] Mapped outside help vs block plant supply chain
- [x] Migrate srm-dispatch source into this repo
- [x] Migrate srm-management-os content (SOPs, personnel, scripts, affirmations, dashboard.html)
- [x] Add 908 block plant to plant config (ALL_PLANTS + SUBS)
- [x] Update package.json (name, homepage) and vite.config.js (base path)
- [x] Created docs/master-plan.md with phased roadmap
- [x] npm install && npm run build — passes clean
- [ ] Build load priority engine (block plants first)
- [ ] Integrate SAMSARA data feeds
- [ ] Build weekly load report (loads per plant, SRM vs outside)

### 2026-03-14 — Session 2: Load Maximization Features
- [x] Fixed CSS reference: created root styles.css for SOP/scripts/personnel/affirmations pages
- [x] Created src/utils/loadCounter.js (countLoadsPerPlant, getPlantPriority, getSRMResponsibility)
- [x] Created src/components/PlantDashboard.jsx — plant status grid with priority colors
- [x] Wired PlantDashboard into App.jsx with PLANTS tab in crew tabs area
- [x] Plant dashboard reacts to audibles (plant down) and day changes via shArgs
- [x] Added "Management OS" link in dispatch footer → dashboard.html
- [x] Added "Dispatch Router" link in dashboard.html footer → index.html
- [x] npm run build passes clean
- [ ] Load priority scoring engine (weight routes by plant need)
- [ ] Route weight optimization (prefer block plant deliveries)
- [ ] Weekly load report

### Next Session Priorities
1. Load priority scoring engine — weight routes by block plant urgency
2. Route weight optimization — prefer block plant deliveries when routing
3. Weekly fairness/load report (loads per plant, SRM vs outside, per driver)
4. Update srm-dispatch-router skill with new outside help logic

- [ ] Printable output option
- [ ] Fairness logic intact
- [ ] Block plants never starved
